1. Connect the MS51PC0AE development board to the power supply and establish a UART connection to your PC.

2. Open Keil uVision IDE, create a new project, and select the 8051 microcontroller (MS-51PC0AE).

3. Write the C code to initialize the UART and transmit data.

4. Compile the code and check for errors.

5. Load the compiled code onto the MS51PC0AE using a suitable programmer.

	a. Open NuvoISP

	b. In Connection Interface, choose “UART” and the COM port accordingly.

	c. Press “Reset Button” on the board

	d. Load the bin file by clicking on “APROM”

	e. The relative path will be similar to: “8051_D11_EXPERIMENTS\SampleCode\RegBased\UART0_Printf\Keil\Output\UART0_Printf.bin”

	f. Select APROM under the Programming section at the Bottom

	g. Click “Start”

6. Open a serial terminal on the PC (Arduino IDE), set the baud rate, and connect to the correct COM port.

7. Run the program, and observe the transmitted data on the terminal.
